Portfolio website
=================

Website portfolio of MazeFX for kickstarting my carreer as a developer.
Took some shortcuts to get a simple one page website running.

Is going to be part of a more comprehensive website structure with more of a General blog website combined with a portfolio.
Will be a attempt to create my own cookiecutter template based on cookiecutter-django but with MySQL database for deployment on a free *pythonanywhere.com* account.

Settings
--------

Settings for django project is broken down into 3 files under */website/config/settings/*.

(Based on standard setup from cookiecutter-django template, noted here are the changed settings)

* Base
* Local
* Production

Test coverage
-------------

No test provided yet. Still under construction.

.. TODO - Write description for tests.


To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployment
----------

No deployment settings provided as of yet as of yet.
will write a section for deployment instructions and settings for global deployment and for deployment on *pythonanywhere.com*.

.. TODO - Collect and Write deployment instructions.
